# QIF_processor
Takes QIF file generated by internet banking site and tailors it for my accounting software.

# deleteQifTransaction
Delete transfers that have already been processed from another account.
Code is derived from parseQif so parseQif should probably be enhanced to process deletions via a command-line switch.
